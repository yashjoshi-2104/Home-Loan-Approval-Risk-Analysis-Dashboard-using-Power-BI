# Home-Loan-Approval-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
## Project Overview

This Power BI project offers an analytical view of a home loan application dataset. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand the key factors influencing loan approval decisions. It provides insights into applicant demographics, financial attributes, and their correlation with loan status.

## Key Features & Visualizations

* **Approval Rate KPI:** A clear overview of the overall loan approval and rejection rates.
* **Applicant Demographics:** Analysis of loan approvals based on gender, marital status, education level, and number of dependents.
* **Financial Analysis:** Visualizations showing the relationship between applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, and the likelihood of approval.
* **Impact of Credit History:** A clear breakdown illustrating the critical importance of credit history on loan approval status.
* **Property Area Insights:** Analysis of loan distribution and approval rates across different property areas (Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural).

## Tools Used

* **Power BI Desktop:** The primary tool for creating the data model, DAX measures, and visualizations.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating key metrics like `Approval Rate %`, `Total Applicants`, etc.
